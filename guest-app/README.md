# SpringSecurity
Spring Security concepts

- Implement basic authentication (added the spring security dependency into the pom and ApplicationSecurityConfiguration which provide the provision to enter the credential to access the web page).
- In memory authentication (In this we will not get the temp password in the logs as basic authentication but we will provide the credentials and it's roles there.)
- JDBC authentication (In this we removed the user credentials from the code and authenticating from DB).
- Leveraging bcrypt for hashing.
- Authorization
- Form-based authentication, Introduced html login-logout page.
- User credentials(ssharma - password, sumits - foobar)
